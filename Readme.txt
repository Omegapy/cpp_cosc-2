Laramie County Community College (LCCC),  
where I am a third-semester STEM, Computer Science Major student,  
gave me credit for Computer science-2,  
due to my prior education at the Array School.
I no longer need to take the class COSC 2030 – Computer Science 2

Due date : 02/07/2023
CWeek 3: Structures


											Movie Data

	Write a program that creates a structure to store information.  The data stored should include the following: 

		Title
		Director
		Year Released
		Running Time (in minutes)
		Production Costs
		Profits

	Create two instances of your structure and input the data from two different movies 
	(yes, just google the information (I'll even overlook the use of wikipedia for this)).  
	Pass the structure to a function for output, display the information for both instances of the structure 
	and take a screen capture of the output.

	Submit your screen capture, and .cpp file in a zipped folder.  Don't forget to comment your program!

	Avatar (2009) https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Avatar#tab=summary
		Title: Avatar
		Director: James Cameron	 
		Year Released: 2009
		Running Time (in minutes): 162 minutes
		Production Costs (Production budget): $237,000,000
		Profits: (Worldwide Box Office) - (Production budget) = $2,899,384,102 - $237,000,000 = $2,662,384,102
				
	Avengers: Endgame https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Avengers-Endgame-(2019)#tab=summary
		Title: Avengers: Endgame
		Director: Joe Russo		 
		Year Released: 2019
		Running Time (in minutes): 181 minutes
		Production Costs (Production budget): $400,000,000
		Profits: (Worldwide Box Office) - (Production budget) = $2,794,731,755 - $400,000,000 = $2,394,731,755

						Employee Class

Requirement:

    MS Windows 10
    c++ 11 or later
    I used MS Visual Studio IDE to create my program.


Due date : 01/31/ 2022
Classes and Objects Review

					Employee Class

Write a class that will hold the following information:
	- name (first and last name should each be stored in string variables),
	- ID Number (you will generate these (1-25 is fine) and they should be sequential),
	- pay rate (a percentage in the form of a decimal), 
	- and base pay (an integer).

Create a file of names to read in both the first and last name of each of your fictional employees,
assigning each one an id number at the same time.  
The names and id numbers should be stored in arrays or vectors (your choice).
Assign each employee a pay rate and use 15,000 as the base pay.  
There should be a minimum of 25 employees.

Create get and set functions for each part of the class and create both default and overloaded constructors.
Remember that constructors will have the exact same name as the class they are part of! (Yes, capitalization matters!)

Create objects for each employee, using either the default or the overloaded constructor.
Print out the details (nicely spaced and with proper labels) for employees number 9 through 19
with their calculated pay instead of the base pay.  
Calculated pay is one plus their pay rate multiplied by the base pay.
( 1+PR ) * BP

When complete take a screen capture of the required output and place it in your project folder.
ZIP YOUR ENTIRE PROJECT FOLDER and submit it for grading.
