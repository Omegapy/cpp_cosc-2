					Employee Class

Write a class that will hold the following information:
	- name (first and last name should each be stored in string variables),
	- ID Number (you will generate these (1-25 is fine) and they should be sequential),
	- pay rate (a percentage in the form of a decimal), 
	- and base pay (an integer).

Create a file of names to read in both the first and last name of each of your fictional employees,
assigning each one an id number at the same time.  
The names and id numbers should be stored in arrays or vectors (your choice).
Assign each employee a pay rate and use 15,000 as the base pay.  
There should be a minimum of 25 employees.

Create get and set functions for each part of the class and create both default and overloaded constructors.
Remember that constructors will have the exact same name as the class they are part of! (Yes, capitalization matters!)

Create objects for each employee, using either the default or the overloaded constructor.
Print out the details (nicely spaced and with proper labels) for employees number 9 through 19
with their calculated pay instead of the base pay.  
Calculated pay is one plus their pay rate multiplied by the base pay.
( 1+PR ) * BP

When complete take a screen capture of the required output and place it in your project folder.
ZIP YOUR ENTIRE PROJECT FOLDER and submit it for grading.
